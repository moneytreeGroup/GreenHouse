      "light_requirements": "Snake Plants prefer bright, indirect light but can tolerate low light conditions. They can also withstand direct sunlight, although too much can cause leaf burn.",
      "watering_needs": "Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Water thoroughly, then let the pot drain to prevent root rot. Snake Plants are drought-tolerant and can go for weeks without water, especially in cooler temperatures.",
      "soil_preferences": "Use a well-draining potting mix, such as cactus or succulent soil. Adding perlite or sand to standard potting soil can improve drainage and prevent water retention.",
      "temperature_humidity": "Snake Plants thrive in temperatures between 70°F to 90°F (21°C to 32°C). They can tolerate lower temperatures but should be protected from frost. Average household humidity is sufficient for these plants.",
      "fertilization": "Feed Snake Plants with a balanced, liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength during the growing season (spring and summer). Fertilize once a month and reduce feeding in the fall and winter.",
      "pruning_maintenance": "Remove any dead or damaged leaves by cutting them at the base. Repot Snake Plants every 2-3 years to refresh the soil and accommodate growth. Clean the leaves occasionally to remove dust and enhance their appearance."

      "watering_needs": "Yucca is highly drought-tolerant and prefers dry conditions.Indoor Care: Water only when the top 2-3 inches of soil are dry.Outdoor Care: Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings.Avoid: Overwatering, which can cause root rot.",
      "soil_preferences": "Yucca thrives in well-draining, sandy or gritty soil.Ideal Mix (Indoor): Cactus or succulent potting mix, or a mix of potting soil, sand, and perlite.pH Level: Slightly acidic to neutral (pH 6.0 - 7.0).",
      "temperature_humidity": "Temperature: Prefers temperatures between 60°F and 80°F (15°C to 27°C).Cold Tolerance: Can tolerate cooler temperatures down to 30°F (-1°C) for short periods, depending on the variety.Humidity: Low to moderate; does well in typical household conditions.",
      "fertilization": "Yucca does not require heavy feeding.Frequency: Fertilize once every 2-3 months during the growing season (spring and summer).Type: Balanced, water-soluble fertilizer diluted to half strength.",
      "pruning_maintenance": "Pruning: Remove dead or damaged leaves as needed.Repotting (Indoor): Every 2-3 years or when the plant becomes root-bound.Cleaning: Wipe leaves occasionally to remove dust and allow for better photosynthesis."

      "watering_needs": "Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Water thoroughly when the top inch of soil is dry to the touch. Overwatering can lead to root rot, so it’s better to err on the side of underwatering.",

      "temperature_humidity": "ZZ Plants thrive in average household temperatures between 60°F and 75°F (15°C to 24°C). They can tolerate low humidity but appreciate occasional misting, especially in dry environments.",
      "fertilization": "Feed ZZ Plants with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer diluted to half strength every 2-3 months during the growing season (spring and summer). Avoid fertilizing in the fall and winter when the plant's growth slows down.",
      "pruning_maintenance": "Remove any yellow or damaged leaves to maintain the plant's appearance and health. Repot ZZ Plants every 2-3 years to refresh the soil and accommodate growth."
